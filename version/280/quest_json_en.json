Fluids are being sent first, then items.<br/>You can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock.<br/><br/>If you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.<br/><br/>You can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids.

There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!<br/><br/>Ha ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.<br/><br/>Bees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behavior of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding.<br/><br/>A trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn] or §9Recessive§r. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.<br/><br/>When breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.<br/><br/>When you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.<br/><br/>Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.<br/><br/>Once you get a new species, it will replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.<br/><br/>All quests require purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the same as the active one.<br/><br/>All traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself.

Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?<br/><br/>The caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).<br/><br/>How is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.<br/><br/>The speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.<br/><br/>Make one of these multis to continue.

With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.<br/><br/>It's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.<br/><br/>Your target is Sugar and an MV Electrolyzer.

There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers.

Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.<br/><br/>Coal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal.

If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.<br/><br/>After building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet.

If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.<br/><br/>ATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this.

With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.<br/><br/>As a final note, the towers do process things slowly.

If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!<br/><br/>For now, focus on putting together the machines needed to get from Saplings to Fermented Biomass.

It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.<br/><br/>The rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings.<br/><br/>To note, Ammonia is required to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel, which you can make from Biodiesel.

There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.<br/><br/>The automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.<br/><br/>The non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work.

Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; it is recommended to also place an MV battery in it to keep it fully charged. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.<br/><br/>The cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer. You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).<br/><br/>You can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click \"process\" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.<br/><br/>When trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the % chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.<br/><br/>Use the crops guide at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url] for more details.<br/><br/>A large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example.

So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> ore block -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreb block.<br/><br/>5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrient stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops it's safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as it's a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bone meal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).<br/><br/>§1Humidity§r:<br/>2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.<br/><br/>10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, although unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.<br/><br/>§6Air Quality§r:<br/>4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.<br/><br/>4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks starting at Y79.<br/>79 - 1 point<br/>94 - 2 points<br/>109 - 3 points<br/>124 - 4 points<br/><br/>2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess.<br/><br/>§aGrowability§r:<br/>Your crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.<br/><br/>Growability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has.

Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane.<br/><br/>Make a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdWdFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>Now place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.<br/><br/>When they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.<br/><br/>With some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.<br/><br/>Weeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.<br/><br/>Using 3x1 plots is easy and not much work. Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.<br/><br/>If you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.<br/><br/>Note that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.<br/><br/>Don't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing.<br/><br/>Crossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick.

This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.<br/><br/>Breaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).<br/><br/>Belladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant.

It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.<br/><br/>Garlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.<br/><br/>Wolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant.

Be quiet.)<br/><br/>The whole idea is that the energy of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that can retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far better than water. The Solar Tower transfers heat to all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If there's too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away all the heat and slow down the entire process.<br/><br/>In more detail, the Solar Tower has a heat value that ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar Salt at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per cycle depends on the number of Reflectors, but also the current heat value: this process is optimal at exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect tower setup, you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt to maintain this heat value, taking away just enough heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what the flow rate is, given that it depends on how many Reflectors you have.<br/><br/>From there, generate Steam or SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as Hot Coolant does it.

You can pump it directly from Neptune, through the Space Elevator or simply by centrifuging the Deuterium you already automated for Helium Plasma.","quest_id":"Ng5Ldnf3TZCefB4Mr3u-rQ==","title":"Zzzincing...","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Zzzincing...</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Force Plasma -

This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.<br/><br/>Breaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).<br/><br/>Belladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.<br/><br/>Snowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally an Icy Needle.<br/><br/>Water Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.<br/><br/>Water Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.<br/><br/>Garlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.<br/><br/>Garlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.<br/><br/>Wolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant.

However, like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not consume the catalyst's durability on recipe finish, behaving more like a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used only with those coils that make it last forever.<br/><br/>Given that there is no durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However, there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting the amount of catalysts it has in its Bulk Catalyst Housing for the recipe in question (limit of 2,147,483,647). This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.<br/><br/>Every catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to be used to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.<br/><br/>To improve the general speed of processing, your one options is to get more parallels with catalysts. The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve the QFT processing.<br/><br/>If the correct plasmas are added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can't be maintained with those “foreign” substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.<br/><br/>There are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are only theoretical.<br/><br/>The first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q==","title":"Catalyzing Miracles","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Catalyzing Miracles</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Chemical Pseudo-Altercations"},{"name":"Chemical Pseudo-Altercations","symbolSize":51.09,"symbol":"","x":822.0,"y":30.0,"data":"Learning more about the world and its ways is a sign of wisdom. However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.<br/><br/>This multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack's progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.<br/><br/>The Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It's a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it's available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earliest QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.<br/><br/>Each recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.<br/><br/>Simply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way.<br/><br/>This direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it's impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won't do anything, and better materials don't seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.<br/><br/>[note]Tip: Use multiple Bulk Catalyst Housings to run additional QFT recipes within the same structure[/note]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w==","title":"Chemical Pseudo-Altercations","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Chemical Pseudo-Altercations</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>My Eyes Hurt! #4<br/>Netherite Materials<br/>Galaxy in a Bottle...?<br/>Well This Looks...

The Cleanroom is an interesting multiblock, because you will be placing other machines §oinside§r of the room!<br/><br/>The cleanroom is a hollow multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. The base does not need to be a square; a rectangular shape is fine. The top layer is built out of Filter Machine Casings, except for the edges, which are Plascrete Blocks. The controller needs to be in the center of the top layer. If the width or length of the room are even, then it can be any one of the two (or four) middle blocks. The rest of the structure is built out of Plascrete Blocks.<br/><br/>Up to 30% of those Plascrete Blocks can be replaced by other valid blocks or materials:<br/><br/>A Reinforced Door lets you get in and out of the cleanroom. Make sure to keep the doors closed, or the cleanroom will rapidly lose efficiency. Travel Anchors and Elevators also work, you can even embed them in the floor if you want to.<br/><br/>In order to automate power and item transport through the walls, you can use Cable Diodes or Machine Hulls. Just be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.<br/><br/>If you want to see inside, you can use any EV+ tier glass (for example, Reinforced Glass or Managlass). If the Cleanroom does not form, mind the 30% limit: often the problem is that you added too much glass.<br/><br/>Finally, the Cleanroom itself will need a Maintenance and Energy Hatch to run. The power usage of this multiblock is a bit unusual. It starts out at 40 EU/t and then gradually goes down. But even when it uses 40 EU/t - which is usually MV - a single LV energy hatch suffices, as long as you give it enough power. Just keep in mind that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the rule.<br/><br/>Let's build a 5x5x5 room for now. You can expand it later as needed. Give it power and let it run until it reaches 100% efficiency. Below 100% efficiency, machines inside the cleanroom have a chance to void outputs, so you want to keep the cleanroom running at all times!<br/><br/>Any maintenance issue reduces the maximum efficiency by 10%. Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.<br/><br/><br/>[note]Multiblocks such as the Large Chemical Reactor or Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver don't need to be in a cleanroom. However, you will still need the cleanroom later on for other machines, like Bio Labs.[/note]<br/><br/>[note]Other helpful hints: you can use an AE Wireless Connector or a Transvector Interface for item transport to avoid machine hulls, and use a higher tier energy hatch to reach 100% efficiency faster.[/note]<br/><br/>[warn]Keep in mind that you can not use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution, or the cleanroom will stop working.[/warn]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA==","title":"§6§lCleanroom","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>Cleanroom</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>You're Gonna Hate This 1-4 in HV"},{"name":"Collision Course","symbolSize":40.87,"symbol":"","x":672.0,"y":588.0,"data":"Finally, to actually get some ICs, use your photons in a Target Chamber.<br/><br/>Note that the EU/t value listed in TC recipes is only a minimum, as recipe time is entirely determined by the Amount of photons you give the multi.<br/><br/>More specifically, you can get the recipe time by dividing recipe Amount by your input beam Amount, then multiplying that by 5s.","quest_id":"9Pc7p99ASnybsIbWmmg0LQ==","title":"Collision Course","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Collision Course</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Synchrotron (No Relation to the Catalyst)"},{"name":"Component Assembly Line","symbolSize":40.87,"symbol":"","x":492.0,"y":468.0,"data":"Check the NEI pages to see all the nice recipes this machine can handle for you.

The logic for this change is as follows:<br/><br/>-> Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;<br/>-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);<br/>-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);<br/>-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, set the focused output to 100% and the rest to 0%.<br/><br/>In general, this type of focusing doesn't increase the total amount of outputs, save for the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities. Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing at all.<br/><br/>When Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one of them is 100%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%, which happens with high-tier nep focusing.<br/><br/>When an output is successfully focused with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100% chance. This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:<br/><br/>-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/4 of the \"failure\" chance (for example, a 50% chance output has a 50% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%, becoming 62.5%)<br/>-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/3 of the \"failure\" chance<br/>-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the \"failure\" chance<br/><br/>With the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.<br/><br/>Many lategame multis have parallels, which means they complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs, in general.<br/><br/>Given that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels for the focused output if it's nep focused to the maximum of 100%, since it was 25% originally.<br/><br/>This is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.<br/><br/>This further applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the multi.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A==","title":"Focusing Science and Mystery","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Focusing Science and Mystery</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Chemical Pseudo-Altercations"},{"name":"Getting Muddy With Monazite","symbolSize":40.87,"symbol":"","x":492.0,"y":348.0,"data":"Pretty soon you're going to need lanthanide elements.

Pollution is nobody's friend!<br/><br/>During setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!<br/><br/>Make sure your muffler hatch is placed on the top middle block. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!<br/><br/>When placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.<br/><br/>Output hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!<br/><br/>When building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls.

However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.<br/><br/>The first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.<br/><br/>Between IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.<br/><br/>At those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.<br/><br/>Another kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these.<br/><br/>From then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.<br/><br/>This page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ==","title":"Basis for All Reactors","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Basis for All Reactors</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Tier 4 (EV)"},{"name":"Bismuth Plasma For Soldering","symbolSize":28.0,"symbol":"","x":696.0,"y":672.0,"data":"Who in their right mind would use a plasma to solder things together?

It is once again about the Mutated Living Solder, and now its fluid inputs: Tin Plasma and Bismuth Plasma. These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're needed now. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end.<br/><br/>The recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy.

In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.<br/><br/>How do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.<br/><br/>How does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup.

Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly.<br/><br/>First off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.<br/><br/>Is this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this. Later on, however, you will encounter other recipes that consume the anomaly, namely the casings for the Quantum Force Transformer, so it will be important to automate their production by then.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw==","title":"Duranium and the Cyclotron","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Duranium and the Cyclotron</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Tin Plasma From T2<br/>Fusing Americium and Tritanium"},{"name":"Establishment of Fusion","symbolSize":28.0,"symbol":"","x":612.0,"y":576.0,"data":"Fusion is the lategame.

First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.<br/><br/>This part is where it becomes complicated, though.

The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE).

This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor.

For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.<br/><br/>That said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140% and 123,480 EU/t.<br/><br/>[note]Note: the suggestions in this questline might be outdated, and there might be other options that are just as good, if not better.

The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output. There are two other outputs, U Salt and UF6, that come from every fuel, although better fuels output more of these per cycle.

What does it mean?<br/><br/>Well, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.<br/><br/>There are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size.<br/><br/>The structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.<br/><br/>Other than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish.

MOX.<br/><br/>MOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics.

The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 mB at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.<br/><br/>Let's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel.

Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe.

The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.<br/><br/>There is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here.<br/><br/>Your best option for a turbine in the IV tier is the HSS-E at 170% turbine efficiency.<br/><br/>There is another turbine at 180% efficiency with the HSS-S however; this turbine requires a robust platinum line completed to spare the resources for it.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXg==","title":"Powering-up Fluid Nukes","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Powering-up Fluid Nukes</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Large Heat Infrastructure"},{"name":"Radioactivity's Additives","symbolSize":28.0,"symbol":"","x":804.0,"y":240.0,"data":"The Naquadah Reactor has the potential to be an endgame power generator, but only if the right additives are used.

In GTNH, though, we have better materials.<br/><br/>The first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!<br/><br/>The usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier.

Although this sounds like clickbait it is true. From a certain point of view.<br/><br/>Use the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.<br/><br/>Sounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!<br/><br/>The multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right-clicking the controller with a screwdriver.<br/><br/>When you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.<br/>You will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this \"debug\" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.<br/><br/>Of course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...<br/><br/>If you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.

Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.<br/><br/>Sending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.<br/><br/>A generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage. For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.<br/><br/>Most machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't receive most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.<br/><br/>Some machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.<br/><br/>If you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.<br/><br/>A single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.<br/><br/>Note that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.<br/><br/>If this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to read more.<br/><br/>If you prefer to learn via video there are also great YouTube resources such as HamCorp's Electricity Guide: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpDPY8J-4QY[/url]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ==","title":"§3§lSafety First","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Safety First</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Steam-a-licious!"},{"name":"Single Use Battery: Mercury","symbolSize":28.05,"symbol":"","x":-36.0,"y":36.0,"data":"Mercury and acid batteries are single-use batteries.

Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.<br/><br/>Sending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.<br/><br/>A generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage. For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.<br/><br/>Most machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't receive most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.<br/><br/>Some machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.<br/><br/>If you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.<br/><br/>A single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.<br/><br/>Note that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.<br/><br/>If this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to read more.<br/><br/>If you prefer to learn via video there are also great YouTube resources such as HamCorp's Electricity Guide: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpDPY8J-4QY[/url]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ==","title":"§3§lSafety First","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Safety First</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Steam-a-licious!"},{"name":"Silver Barrel","symbolSize":22.22,"symbol":"","x":504.0,"y":192.0,"data":"The Silver barrel has 72 slots.","quest_id":"fhzjYvdATJuUQTMUO1pVvA==","title":"§3§lSilver Barrel","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Silver Barrel</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>The future is here!"},{"name":"Slime Island Journey","symbolSize":22.22,"symbol":"","x":744.0,"y":420.0,"data":"Rubber trees are not the only source for raw rubber.

This happens to villagers as well.<br/><br/>Animals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, they prefer lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens, or at least not crowd the edges, by removing grass from around both sides of the fence and under it, and by placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat, which reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly, place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.<br/><br/>Also, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot.

Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane.<br/><br/>Make a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdWdFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>Now place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.<br/><br/>When they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.<br/><br/>With some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.<br/><br/>Weeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.<br/><br/>Using 3x1 plots is easy and not much work. Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.<br/><br/>If you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.<br/><br/>Note that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.<br/><br/>Don't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing.<br/><br/>Crossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation.

You don't need them when searching.<br/><br/>By default the search works like in the extended mode, searching in §lany§r of the inputs and outputs of a recipe. So if you search a recipe by `§1-§rdust`, it would return all the recipes where there's at least one item that doesn't have §o\"dust\"§r.<br/><br/>Let's say you want to search only in §linputs§r. Put §a<§r before your search query to do that! For example `§a<§riron` returns all the recipes with §o\"iron\"§r in one of the §linputs§r, `§a<§rsteel§5@gregtech§r` returns the recipes with at least one item from mods, containing §9Gregtech§r in their name, with §o\"steel\"§r.<br/><br/>But then, if you search by `§a<§1-§rdust` it still returns the recipes with §o\"dust\"§r on the left. Why is that? Because §a<§r searches among §lany§r items. So if there's one item that doesn't have §o\"dust\"§r, then it would still match the recipe, even if the rest of the inputs are dusts.<br/><br/>To solve this use §a<&§r instead. Like this: `§a<&§1-§rdust`. It returns §lall§r the recipes without §o\"dust\"§r among the inputs! §a<&§r sets a §lstrict§r condition on §lall§r inputs, unlike §a<§r that sets a condition on §lany§r input.<br/><br/>To filter the §loutputs§r use §a>§r and §a>&§r. They work the same way, but allow you to filter the §loutputs§r of a recipe. So `§a>§rgold` gives you the recipes with at least one §loutput§r with §o\"gold\"§r. And `§a>&§rgold` gives you the recipes with §o\"gold\"§r in every outputted item.<br/><br/>Want to combine multiple conditions? Sure, just put them one after another in any order. E.g. you could search for `§a<§riron§a>§rsteel`, `§a<&§r §1-§b$dust§r §a<§r cell`, `§a>&§1-§rdust cell`.<br/><br/>Or even for `dust§a>§rcell`. Here the non-prefixed part works like default, searching among §lany§r items from the inputs or outputs. So this query returns the recipes with §o\"dust\"§r in one of the inputs or outputs and §o\"cell\"§r in one of the outputs.<br/><br/>In some recipes you might have items that don't belong to inputs or outputs. In order to filter them use `§a^§r` and `§a^&§r` respectively.<br/><br/>You could add spaces for readability too, because (unless you have space mode on) spaces could be used anywhere while in extended+ mode.","quest_id":"hmQlN9vLSEOyCnCSOOXz7Q==","title":"§2§lNEI Next Level Recipe Search","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>NEI Next Level Recipe Search</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>NEI Next Level Search"},{"name":"NEI Next Level Search","symbolSize":23.59,"symbol":"","x":660.0,"y":12.0,"data":"NEI search got improved even further!<br/><br/>Select a search mode extended+ to try it out!<br/><br/>Extended+ works pretty much like extended, but it doesn't support * and ? expanding in the names.

You could use a quote inside quotes too, but you would have to escape it. Like this: `§6\"§r\\\"§6\"§r`.<br/><br/>Use curly brackets §7{}§r to group conditions. Searching for `§7{§rmytryl§7|§rmanasteel§7}§r hammer head` would show you hammer heads made out of mytryl or manasteel.<br/><br/>Space is no longer necessary to use. So `§7{§rmytryl§7|§rmanasteel§7}§rhammer` works too!<br/><br/>There's a space mode support, so if you want your spaces to work literally turn it on!<br/><br/>Quotes no longer require a closing quote. So you could search for `§6\"§riron ingot` and it would work! You still do need a quote if you want your quotes to end though.<br/><br/>Regex syntax got simplified (though the old one is still supported). Now instead of `§br/§rsome regex§b/§r` you could search for `§b/§rsome regex` and it would work too! You still do need a slash if you want your regex to end. Regex doesn't require escaping, the same way quotes don't, with the only exception being the `/`. So to find a slash with a regex you would search with `§b/§r\\/`.<br/><br/>You can use quotes or regex after prefix to search with them instead of a plain text. For example, use `§5@§6\"§5chest minecarts§r` to search for items from the §9Iron Chest Minecarts§r mod.

However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.<br/><br/>This multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack's progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.<br/><br/>The Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It's a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it's available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earliest QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.<br/><br/>Each recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.<br/><br/>Simply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way.<br/><br/>This direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it's impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won't do anything, and better materials don't seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.<br/><br/>[note]Tip: Use multiple Bulk Catalyst Housings to run additional QFT recipes within the same structure[/note]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w==","title":"Chemical Pseudo-Altercations","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Chemical Pseudo-Altercations</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>My Eyes Hurt! #4<br/>Netherite Materials<br/>Galaxy in a Bottle...?<br/>Well This Looks...

The Eye of Harmony has an inbuilt pity system to make sure you don't lose your mind. Here's a quick rundown on how it operates:<br/><br/>(All chances are decimals here)<br/>There is a counter C that starts at the current recipe success chance P. If a recipe fails, (1-P)*P is added to C. If C reaches >= 1, the next roll is guaranteed to succeed and C resets to P. <br/>If a recipe succeeds before C reaches >= 1, it resets in a similar manner.<br/>If you switch recipes, C will be reset to P of the new recipe, even if the next roll would be a guarantee.<br/>The guarantee can be canceled out by overflow penalties as they apply after the pity does. However, they do not reset C, so the guarantee is shifted to the next recipe cycle.<br/>If parallels are > 1, pity doesn't apply.[/note]<br/>","quest_id":"kazCPEWoSmiZhR4bkHlEBQ==","title":"An Eye at the End of Time","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>An Eye at the End of Time</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Eternal Coil Upgrade<br/>Are you Ready?"},{"name":"Are you Ready?","symbolSize":75.03,"symbol":"","x":324.0,"y":12.0,"data":"From now on, you'll be dealing with extremely slow recipes.<br/><br/>Consider finishing up your QFTs and upgrading or replacing your old infrastructure to save on TPS.<br/><br/>You should definitely upgrade your power generation and infrastructure to handle millions of recipes.<br/><br/>The Eye of Harmony will be consuming most of your power before it starts generating more than it uses.<br/><br/>May Colen have mercy on your soul.<br/><br/>[note]Welcome to the waiting lounge.[/note]","quest_id":"v5GltE2BTW-Me_rEqy5uFg==","title":"Are you Ready?","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>Are you Ready?</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>UXV Circuits<br/>Saving on SpaceTime<br/>UMV Field Generator"},{"name":"A Second Ring has Hit the Godforge","symbolSize":18.76,"symbol":"","x":96.0,"y":-36.0,"data":"As additional rings are placed closer to the star at the center of the Forge, the gravitational stress drastically increases on the structure.

To achieve this, you need a full discount, and the extra power cost is offset by using more of the same catalyst.<br/><br/>Overall, it is more efficient and totally worth it.<br/><br/>This process is extremely catalyst-hungry. Ensure you're producing enough to sustain it.<br/><br/>For recipes without a catalyst, you must specify the catalyst in the GUI by right-clicking the Convergence button, otherwise it will default to Crude.[/note]<br/><br/>[note]Math for the curious:<br/><br/>To clear up what exactly happens in the background, here's an explanation on how the extra catalyst values are calculated using an example:<br/><br/>The example recipe of choice is the molten neutronium recipe using prosaic catalyst, running at 64A UMV (8,589,934,592 EU/t).<br/>The recipe uses 14,753L of Prosaic catalyst and 36,484,545,600 EU per recipe without OCs or the catalyst discount. With the discount, the catalyst amount gets cut in half, meaning 7,376.5§ L of catalyst, which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to the 64A UMV the machine is supplied with the recipe overclocks 3 times, meaning each recipe actually uses 36,484,545,600 * 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU.<br/><br/>Knowing the amount of OCs and the base voltage of the recipe, the difference of the needed EU per recipe with and without perfect OC can be calculated, that being 291,876,364,800 - 36,484,545,600 = 255,391,819,200 extra EU due to imperfect OCs.<br/>To get the value of needed extra catalyst, this extra EU value has to be divided by the energy density of the relevant catalyst, prosaic in this case.<br/><br/>The division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,460 EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra prosaic catalyst per recipe. For the final step, this value has to be multiplied by 0.5 as it's affected by the discount, meaning the total extra catalyst that gets added to the recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,912.5 L, rounded to 1,912L.<br/><br/>To summarize it all in a formula:<br/>Amount extra catalyst per recipe = (B * ((2^x) - 1))/2L<br/>where:<br/>B is base total EU of the recipe<br/>x is the number of overclocks<br/>L is the EU/L of the relevant catalyst [/note]","quest_id":"XoEzTtuPQjyeHTyqp9eY8Q==","title":"Convergence","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Convergence</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>UMV Field Generator"},{"name":"Finally, Universium!","symbolSize":37.52,"symbol":"","x":432.0,"y":180.0,"data":"You've finally solved it.

This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right-click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.<br/><br/>You can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.<br/><br/>If you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.<br/><br/>Once you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval.

So how to obtain Sunnarium? Well there are a couple of ways, but at EV you'll need to radiate Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.<br/><br/>The Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is (number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1) per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.<br/><br/>As you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to set up. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely.

[warn]Always test in Creative first![/warn]<br/><br/>When using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.<br/><br/>If you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 158% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400% of optimal flow to produce 214% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550% of optimal flow to produce 301% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.<br/><br/>The choice is yours!<br/><br/>[note]For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line

There are a few things you need to understand before using one.<br/><br/>§lCONSTRUCTION§r. Much like an assembly line, the QC is built as a series of slices. The first and last slice are the only valid locations for hatches. The slices in between are primarily for computer racks. The Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector shows the minimum length QC, but holding multiple in a single stack will show/build longer versions up to the maximum length of 16. There is also a mandatory air block in front of the computer heat vents.<br/><br/>§lOUTPUT§r. Computation is nothing more than an integer input for certain recipes--much like EU. There may exist a minimum throughput requirement, a threshold to reach, or both (NEI will tell you everything). Computation is generated every second by the QC, transmitted by an Optical Transmission Connector, received by an Optical Reception Connector, and \"consumed\" by the machine or process that needs it. There is no storing computation and there can only be ONE transmission or reception hatch connected to the same Optical Fiber Cables at a time. If absolutely necessary, the Network Switch with QoS can split/join connections but know that it takes both power and maintenance to run.<br/><br/>Additional QC can be chained together using another set of Optical Transmission and Optical Reception Connectors between machines, but they cannot wallshare the same Optical Transmission Connector.<br/><br/>§lUNCERTAINTY§r. The QC has a unique maintenance requirement that can only be corrected by balancing the Schrödinger Matrix inside an Uncertainty Resolver--an additional hatch that must go on either the first or last slice of the machine. Start with the basic Uncertainty Resolver, but know that there are two more tiers unlocked later on that lower the difficulty of the puzzle, or not?<br/><br/>The interface of the Uncertainty Resolver has the Schrödinger Matrix in the middle and two sets of 8 buttons on the left and right. Clicking on one button and then another will switch the states of the two corresponding cells in the matrix. This means switching their blinking speed (in the basic Uncertainty Resolver) or their shade/color (in the Uncertainty Resolver X). The goal of the puzzle is to balance the states of the matrix around the glowing LED lights, turning all of them green.<br/><br/>§lPARAMETERS§r. In the GUI of the controller, there are two configurable parameters, overclock and overvolt, that change how computation and heat are generated. Higher overclock values contribute the most to computation and higher overvolt values contribute the most to heat. Alone, this would encourage the player to make overclock as high as possible and overvolt as low as possible, but there is a penalty to computation for large differences between these two parameters. Furthermore, overvolt values <1 will cause the QC to randomly drop computation proportional to its distance from 1. It is highly encouraged to play around with these parameters, as all the best setups do.<br/><br/>See the adjacent quest for more information on computer racks and generating computation.","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w==","title":"Quantum Computer","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>Quantum Computer</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>UV Energy Hatch<br/>The Beginning of the End Game"},{"name":"Quantum Mechanics is Hot","symbolSize":18.09,"symbol":"","x":168.0,"y":168.0,"data":"The QC has 2-24 computer racks depending on the length of the machine. Each rack has four total slots for either circuits (to generate heat and computation) or vents (to dissipate heat). Although conceptually similar to a nuclear reactor, the location of the components inside does not matter at all. Every rack is also completely independent from every other rack which means it is not possible to have one rack with all circuits and another with all vents.<br/><br/>The computation of a rack is the sum of all the components' individual computation. For example, two APU (Tier 3) and two Cooling Cores have 240 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 480 base computation per second. However, computation changes significantly depending on the values for overclock and overvolt:<br/><br/>[note]Computation = Base * (1+overclock^2) / (1+(overclock-overvolt)^2)[/note]<br/><br/>The heat of a rack is a value between 0 and 10,000 and is reported in the interface of the QC or by using a Portable Scanner on the rack. Every component has a certain heat limit which if exceeded will void that component. Breaking or wrenching a rack while it is hot (>2000) will similarly void the components inside. The QC will explode if the heat exceeds 10,000 but no component has a heat limit greater than that, so don't worry too much about ruining your base.<br/><br/>[note]Heat α HeatConstant * overclock * overvolt^2[/note]<br/><br/>The power consumption of a rack is 1A ZPM regardless of the components inside. This is in addition to the 1A ZPM of the QC itself. However, these EU/t values are directly proportional to overclock and overvolt which should increase as you unlock better circuits. Be sure to turn on the QC before the research station and only when you need it.<br/><br/>[note]EU/t = 131,072 * overclock * overvolt * (racks + 1)[/note]<br/><br/>To get you started, craft 4x APU (Tier 3) and 4x Cooling Cores. Place two of each component in the two racks and the QC will safely produce 1,920 computation/s for just 393,215 EU/t (0.75A UV) which is more than enough for researching the Wetware Mainframe.

You can later upgrade that to up to 12 with Mk-II and Mk-III motors. The motor tier also determines the module tier that you can use. The I/O is not shared between modules, each module only sees their own I/O slots.

It consumes 1A UHV to work. The Gas Type and Planet Type are parameters.<br/><br/>NEI also has an overview of all the ores you can obtain with a Space Mining Module. It needs to be supplied with a drone, which will act as catalyst, a set of input items, computation and either Helium, Bismuth or Radon plasma. The plasma will boost both the recipe time and the amount of bonus stacks you get out of a recipe. With its parameters you can adjust parallels, overdrive, and distance. When multiple recipes have the same input and you have the distance set to a value that they share, the module will pick a random one, taking the recipes weights into consideration.<br/><br/>The space elevator also lets you travel to other planets, but it doesn't get you back though so better keep that in mind!<br/><br/>The mining module also got a cycle mode.

Every machine that your Assembly Line has crafted works, but the most advanced ones so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges. Further inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't good enough. It seems that Infinity's neverending vibrations destabilize the joints where the soldering happens, your living circuits have been offering resistance to this crude soldering alloy, however that happens...<br/><br/>It's likely that new materials will completely break Indalloy's ability to get pieces soldered together. Because of that, it's about time for a new development in this technology, and the previous rejection by your living circuits has given you an excellent idea. Any new material can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling for you, but what if the solder itself learns about these complications and learns how to adjust to them, mutating for them?<br/><br/>That's right: §aMutated Living Solder§r.<br/><br/>This sort of chemistry is only possible in a full-scale Chemical Plant, equipped with the most advanced casing: Botmium. On top of that, the catalyst you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the mutating Naquadria. Your Infinity will be lost to the crafting, still, unless you manage to put [note]Tungstensteel Pipe Casings[/note] and [warn]Awakened Draconium Coils[/warn] in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst from losing durability. Any better coils also have the same effect.<br/><br/>The new solder itself is a different story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this, and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid that would serve as its carrier for soldering. When you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth, it finally worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It looked like the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill their new job, which could be fixed by adding an example material as a test subject, something simpler like Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond the cells to the dust. You need more energy... not just loads of EU, something concentrated, hot, fizzling with energy!<br/><br/>Yes, everything alive died instantly when you decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids. No surprise there. However, Bio Cells did survive inside hot fluids, so we just need some temperature control here, and some separation between cell and plasma... yes, Gravi Stars can be used for this. We still need to cool down the plasmas, so that the enhanced cells can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone would be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be surprisingly efficient, perhaps due to its origins, as a component of a living being, the Blizz.<br/><br/>There we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The highly intelligent Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated heat of the plasmas, while keeping a distance from them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they analyze the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material instability. This is a very slow process, but it happens at the same time as the plasmas are slowly cooled, using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process is complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and Bismuth, now in the liquid form that was shown to work before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge, the cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced catalyst so that they can mutate in real-time after researching the material they're soldering.<br/><br/>This should work for any future soldering need, regardless of material.

Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient.<br/><br/>Use a Machine Controller Cover on the controller for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next to a casing - casings will transmit the redstone signal. You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing, but not hatches, buses, or other blocks. Use it with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.<br/><br/>With a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.<br/><br/>The best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.<br/><br/>Red alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary.<br/><br/>You can use an Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.<br/><br/>For a video version, check out this video: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64[/url]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg==","title":"§6§lAutomating Power On/Off","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Automating Power On/Off</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>It's Time to Get More Steam<br/>Gas Turbine<br/>Do You Hear That Engine Revving?"},{"name":"Backup Your Stuff...","symbolSize":43.2,"symbol":"","x":108.0,"y":12.0,"data":"The mod ServerUtilities (SU) is included in the pack to backup your world.

There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!<br/><br/>Ha ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.<br/><br/>Bees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behavior of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding.<br/><br/>A trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn] or §9Recessive§r. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.<br/><br/>When breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.<br/><br/>When you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.<br/><br/>Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.<br/><br/>Once you get a new species, it will replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.<br/><br/>All quests require purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the same as the active one.<br/><br/>All traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.<br/><br/>Advanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.<br/><br/>It looks complex, because it is!

The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!<br/><br/>When placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.<br/><br/>Output hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks.

Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane.<br/><br/>Make a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdWdFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>dddFFFddd<br/>FFFdddFFF<br/>Now place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.<br/><br/>When they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.<br/><br/>With some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.<br/><br/>Weeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.<br/><br/>Using 3x1 plots is easy and not much work. Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.<br/><br/>If you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.<br/><br/>Note that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.<br/><br/>Don't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing.<br/><br/>Crossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation.

You don't need them when searching.<br/><br/>By default the search works like in the extended mode, searching in §lany§r of the inputs and outputs of a recipe. So if you search a recipe by `§1-§rdust`, it would return all the recipes where there's at least one item that doesn't have §o\"dust\"§r.<br/><br/>Let's say you want to search only in §linputs§r. Put §a<§r before your search query to do that! For example `§a<§riron` returns all the recipes with §o\"iron\"§r in one of the §linputs§r, `§a<§rsteel§5@gregtech§r` returns the recipes with at least one item from mods, containing §9Gregtech§r in their name, with §o\"steel\"§r.<br/><br/>But then, if you search by `§a<§1-§rdust` it still returns the recipes with §o\"dust\"§r on the left. Why is that? Because §a<§r searches among §lany§r items. So if there's one item that doesn't have §o\"dust\"§r, then it would still match the recipe, even if the rest of the inputs are dusts.<br/><br/>To solve this use §a<&§r instead. Like this: `§a<&§1-§rdust`. It returns §lall§r the recipes without §o\"dust\"§r among the inputs! §a<&§r sets a §lstrict§r condition on §lall§r inputs, unlike §a<§r that sets a condition on §lany§r input.<br/><br/>To filter the §loutputs§r use §a>§r and §a>&§r. They work the same way, but allow you to filter the §loutputs§r of a recipe. So `§a>§rgold` gives you the recipes with at least one §loutput§r with §o\"gold\"§r. And `§a>&§rgold` gives you the recipes with §o\"gold\"§r in every outputted item.<br/><br/>Want to combine multiple conditions? Sure, just put them one after another in any order. E.g. you could search for `§a<§riron§a>§rsteel`, `§a<&§r §1-§b$dust§r §a<§r cell`, `§a>&§1-§rdust cell`.<br/><br/>Or even for `dust§a>§rcell`. Here the non-prefixed part works like default, searching among §lany§r items from the inputs or outputs. So this query returns the recipes with §o\"dust\"§r in one of the inputs or outputs and §o\"cell\"§r in one of the outputs.<br/><br/>In some recipes you might have items that don't belong to inputs or outputs. In order to filter them use `§a^§r` and `§a^&§r` respectively.<br/><br/>You could add spaces for readability too, because (unless you have space mode on) spaces could be used anywhere while in extended+ mode.","quest_id":"hmQlN9vLSEOyCnCSOOXz7Q==","title":"§2§lNEI Next Level Recipe Search","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>NEI Next Level Recipe Search</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>NEI Next Level Search"},{"name":"NEI Next Level Search","symbolSize":43.2,"symbol":"","x":348.0,"y":108.0,"data":"NEI search got improved even further!<br/><br/>Select a search mode extended+ to try it out!<br/><br/>Extended+ works pretty much like extended, but it doesn't support * and ? expanding in the names.

You could use a quote inside quotes too, but you would have to escape it. Like this: `§6\"§r\\\"§6\"§r`.<br/><br/>Use curly brackets §7{}§r to group conditions. Searching for `§7{§rmytryl§7|§rmanasteel§7}§r hammer head` would show you hammer heads made out of mytryl or manasteel.<br/><br/>Space is no longer necessary to use. So `§7{§rmytryl§7|§rmanasteel§7}§rhammer` works too!<br/><br/>There's a space mode support, so if you want your spaces to work literally turn it on!<br/><br/>Quotes no longer require a closing quote. So you could search for `§6\"§riron ingot` and it would work! You still do need a quote if you want your quotes to end though.<br/><br/>Regex syntax got simplified (though the old one is still supported). Now instead of `§br/§rsome regex§b/§r` you could search for `§b/§rsome regex` and it would work too! You still do need a slash if you want your regex to end. Regex doesn't require escaping, the same way quotes don't, with the only exception being the `/`. So to find a slash with a regex you would search with `§b/§r\\/`.<br/><br/>You can use quotes or regex after prefix to search with them instead of a plain text. For example, use `§5@§6\"§5chest minecarts§r` to search for items from the §9Iron Chest Minecarts§r mod. Or `§5@§b/§5chest minecarts§r` to do the same with a regex.","quest_id":"kR1YVSq2R4WFu9KNM9lCZQ==","title":"§2§lNEI Next Level Search","is_main":1,"tooltip":"<strong>NEI Next Level Search</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>NEI is EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW?"},{"name":"Nobody Wants an Explosion...","symbolSize":43.2,"symbol":"","x":300.0,"y":108.0,"data":"...right?

Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.<br/><br/>Sending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.<br/><br/>A generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage. For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.<br/><br/>Most machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't receive most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.<br/><br/>Some machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.<br/><br/>If you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.<br/><br/>A single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.<br/><br/>Note that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.<br/><br/>If this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to read more.<br/><br/>If you prefer to learn via video there are also great YouTube resources such as HamCorp's Electricity Guide: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpDPY8J-4QY[/url]","quest_id":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ==","title":"§3§lSafety First","is_main":0,"tooltip":"<strong>Safety First</strong><br/>Prequest requests:<br/>Steam-a-licious!"},{"name":"Underground Fluids","symbolSize":43.2,"symbol":"","x":204.0,"y":156.0,"data":"So you're probably wondering what all the underground fluids are.

To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for desulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.<br/><br/>Heavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.<br/><br/>The first one you should try is Refinery Gas. In order to make that, you will need to desulfurize Sulfuric Gas, so make some of that in your Distillery.

These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.<br/><br/>Why go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them.

The tall structure is required for the process, because the condensation of the vapors occurs in different temperatures.

This means that compounds with higher boiling points will condense sooner and will end up lower in the column, the opposite is also applicable for compounds with low boiling points.<br/><br/>That said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by allowing you to collect all fractions at once, from the same amount of input.

What do, then?<br/><br/>First off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.<br/><br/>Second off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which are needed to create various important materials. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. Which path you take is up to you.<br/><br/>Now, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:<br/><br/>Light Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydro-cracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydro-cracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.<br/><br/>Heavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it when making your first rocket to be able to get into EV.<br/><br/>Naphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, it's best to just use it for power.<br/><br/>Refinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene.
